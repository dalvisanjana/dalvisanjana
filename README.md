## A Passionate Data Analyst and Data Scientist
 As a Data Analyst with 3 months of internship experience, I have gained practical skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
 
 My journey into coding and data science began when I decided to pursue a career in this field, driven by my passion for extracting meaningful insights from data.
 My career journey began by mastering the fundamental tools and techniques of a Data Analyst’s tech stack. This solid foundation sparked a strong passion for data, driving me to explore and specialize in this 
 dynamic field. Through academic projects and internship experience, I’ve developed a keen eye for detail and a careful approach to data handling, ensuring accuracy and valuable insights in every task I take on.
 
 I believe in collaboration and knowledge sharing. Explore my projects, provide feedback, or reach out for collaborations. Let's use data for impactful change and innovation!
